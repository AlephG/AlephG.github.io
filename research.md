## Unpublished

### A Computational Model of Category-Learning Difficulty (2021)

This paper was written for my Honours Research Project at McGill University conducted under the supervision of Prof. Stevan Harnad. Categorical perception and category-learning difficulty is investigated through the elaboration of a functional model of experimental outcomes.

### A Model of Categorical Perception in the Human Visual System (2021)

This paper and the accompanying code was written as a term project for a computational neuroscience course I took at McGill University. A broadly biologically inspired model of categorical perception in human vision is explored and results from the originators of the model are replicated.
