Hi! I am a third year PhD student at NYU in the [Human and Machine Learning Lab](https://lake-lab.github.io/) and the [Computation and Cognition Lab](http://gureckislab.org/). I did my undergrad at McGill University in Cognitive Science with a minor in Computer Science. I am broadly interested in computational cognitive science: developing computational hypotheses potentially explaining mechanisms of human minds and intelligence. I am interested in research simultaneously contributing to expanding our understanding of cognition and developing more human-like AI systems.

Currently, I am working on understanding insight problem-solving by using a dynamical [physical reasoning game](https://exps.gureckislab.org/e/blue-gigantic-golf/#/) that I designed. I'm also interested in how people reason about [abstract problems](https://arc-visualizations.github.io), program synthesis, metareasoning, abductive reasoning and OOD generalization.

Other than that, I like [music](https://soundcloud.com/solim-legris), bouldering, [reading]({% link readings.md %}), [film](https://boxd.it/7GDUv), writing about stuff I find interesting and enjoying great food!
