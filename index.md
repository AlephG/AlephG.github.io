Hi! I'm a recent graduate from McGill University's Cognitive Science program in the neuroscience concentration with a minor in Computer Science. I am specifically interested in computational cognitive science: developing computational hypotheses potentially explaining mechanisms of human minds and intelligence. More generally, I am interested in research simultaneously contributing to expanding our understanding of cognition and developing more human-like AI systems. I am aiming to start graduate school studies to pursue my research interests in the Fall of 2022.

[//]: # (I will soon be starting a research/data science intership at === where I will be adressing questions about neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in diseased brains.) 

Other than that, I like [music](https://soundcloud.com/solim-legris), running, [reading]({% link readings.md %}),  writing about stuff I find interesting and enjoying great food!

Here is my [resume](/assets/resume/latest-cv.pdf).
