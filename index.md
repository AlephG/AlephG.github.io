  Hi! I'm a recent graduate from McGill University's Cognitive Science program in the neuroscience concentration with a minor in Computer Science. I am specifically interested in computational cognitive science: developing computational hypotheses potentially explaining mechanisms of the mind and human intelligence. I am aiming to start graduate school studies to pursue my research interests in the Fall of 2022.

  I will soon be starting a research/data science intership at ------ where I will be adressing questions about neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in diseased brains using data analytic approaches. 
</p>

  Other than that, I like music, running, writing about stuff I find interesting and enoying great food!
