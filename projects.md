### A Computational Model of Category-Learning Difficulty 
This paper was written for my Honours Research Project at McGill University conducted under the supervision of Prof. Stevan Harnad. Categorical perception and category-learning difficulty is investigated through the elaboration of a functional model of experimental outcomes. \[[pdf](/assets/cp-complexity/a model of category-learning difficulty.pdf)\] \[[repo](https://github.com/AlephG/cp-complexity-model)\]

### A Model of Categorical Perception in the Human Visual System

This paper and the accompanying code was written as a term project for a computational neuroscience course I took at McGill University. A broadly biologically inspired model of categorical perception in human vision is explored and results from the originators of the model are replicated. \[[pdf](/assets/cp-human-vision/categorical perception in human vision.pdf)\] \[[repo](https://github.com/AlephG/cp-human-vision)\]
